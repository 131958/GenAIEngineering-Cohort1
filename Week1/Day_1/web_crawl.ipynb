I enjoyed more the Lost Love story which took me to another world and made me surprised and saddened at the same time. The Lost Love story revolved around a man who fell in love with an imaginary woman he saw in the road near her village when he wanted assistance because his car’s petrol finished. He went with her to her strange village where the life was very old so much so that its people didn’t know what was the meaning of petrol. They wore strange clothes, cooked over a wood fire and they used horses instead of cars. And the most\\ninteresting\\nthing, when the man defined the truth from people of another town which was that this village had a big fire 350 years ago by Oliver Cromwell who killed its people because they helped the king in the war, and no one lived there. This village was alive one day every ten years and no one could ever leave unless they left before morning. So, Mary told him to leave the village before the morning but the tears in her eyes told him the truth. The end was very sad when the man sat dawn on the ground and cried. I liked this story because it seemed to me very exotic and exciting to me to read it to the end that was painful, it removed man’s heart because he lost his love that will never return again. It’s a really strange story that the man lived for one day.\\nIf you want to download all of these learn English novels, please leave your email in the comments section.
